It's over!

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,540
I, Demon King Lukifel, will rule this \Nworld with the darkness of despair.

13

This is the beginning of \Nthe darkest of nights,

14

in which I suck up the dreams of \Nall children around the world!

15
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,700
I won't give up.

16
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,850
I won't let you do that.

We, the Majiha Sisters, will never give up!

19
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,720
Because we believe in the future!

20
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,170

but after that, it seemed like \Nshe was making progress again.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,160
Frankly, I was kinda counting on her.

120
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,550
Now, of all times?

121
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,560
I'll have to go back and try another route.

122
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,580
Damn it.

123
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,080
Damn it!

124
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,750
Damn it!

125
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,180
It's a dead end!

126
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,710
This is beyond impossible!

127
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,410
Crap! An earthquake?!

128
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,640
Oh, come on...

129
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,900

130
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,130
just like the ones in our world.

131
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,040
Not only that, but it's moving in \Na direction I haven't gone yet.

132
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,740
It poses no threat.

133
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,280
Given the circumstances, \NI'm damn glad to see it, but...

134
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,980
It's so slow.

135
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,490
What is this guy's speed, anyway?

136
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,900
But I can't get back to the surface now.

137
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,550
All I can do is trust this \Nguy to do the work.

138
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,730
Hey! Could you pick up the pace a little?

139
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,560
I don't have much time!

the quest might have been set up so that \Ngirl would bail me out at the last minute...

280
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,760
We were seriously just seconds from death.

281
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,910
Who was that magic user?

282
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,560
No, I won't ask that. \NI can't waste this question.

283
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,670
This world...

284
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,090
This world is actually virtual...

285
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,080
like, virtual reality, right?

286
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,800
Parallel worlds.

287
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,150
There is a concept by that na.

288
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,610
Parallel worlds?

289
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,290
Say, for example, \Nthat there is an intersection,

290
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:39,090

as well as a you in a world based on \Ndifferent possibilities who goes left.

294
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:44,060
The you in the world based on different \Npossibilities who goes left

295
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,000
exists in a parallel wor.

296
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:55,440

298
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,170
For that reason, \Nevery time we make a decision,

299
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,450
the potential number of parallel worlds in \Nthe universe increases in a branching struc.

301
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,230
I guess that does make logical sense.

302
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,170
Now, what if the me who went \Nleft died in an accident?

303
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,780
In a parallel world, I would not have di.

304
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,470
So what if that decision was made not \Ntoday, but three years from now?

305
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,330
Among the parallel worlds,

306
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,360
there would exist a world in \Nwhich I died in an accid.

307
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,550
And what if the decision was an action \Ntaken by your parents twenty years ago?

308
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,650
Among the parallel worlds,

309
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,470
there would be one in which \Nyour parents died twenty years ag.

310
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,480
{\fad(444,1)\c&H000000&\3c&HFFFDFF&\4c&HBF3F61&\fs20\pos(98,190.666)}Nonexistent

311
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,650
Naturally, that means \Nyou would not be born.

312
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,360
In this way, parallel worlds become \Nmore and more unrealistic

313
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,420
the farther they branch out from \Nthe past from which they origina.

314
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,060
This branching

315
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,020
has been repeating eternally \Nsince the birth of the univer.

316
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,330
Does that mean the number of parallel \Nworlds is basically infinite?

317
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,350
We are capable of using special methods

318
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,340
to observe and travel between parallel \Nworlds that meet a certain conditio.

319
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,280
The condition is that the worlds \Nexist on a similar wavelength.

320
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,140
Which means that world is...

321
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,880
a world that branched off \N4.6 billion years ago,

322
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,350
where a sentient race identical \Nto humans came to exist

323
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,490
and lived through a history \Nsimilar to human history.

324
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,430
It is an Earth based on different possibil.

325
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,900
What does that mean?!

326
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,500
You do not have the right to ask a ques.

327
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,030
Of course, the name of the planet, \Nthe things it is made of,

328
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,330
and its terrain are diff.

329
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,040
But it is not a virtual realit.

330
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,840
It is a planet that exists in the same \Nplace as Earth in a parallel wor.

331
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,310
If anything, you are the only things \Nin this world that are virtu.

332
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,660
We're virtual?

333
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,220
Well, I guess if we weren't, \Nwe couldn't come back from the dead.

334
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,730
True.

335
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,190
Which means all of the \Nother things there...

336
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,710
the sky, the seas, the land,

337
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,820
the creatures living there, \Nand the humans...

338
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,150
are all perfectly real, \Nflesh-and-blood beings in realit.

339
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,520
So the people in this \Nworld aren't virtual...

340
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:21,450
They're Earthlings that just \Nexist in a parallel reality?

341
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,690
